Check that the modem is recognized by running:
```
ls -l /dev/*USB*
```

## Note about Raspberry
On Raspberry PI 4, you need a udev rule in the config USB stick, for the [Huawei E3372-510 stick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6P3HI2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for it to be recognized.
This config is:
```
udev\10-gsm-modem.rules
```
```
ACTION=="add" \
, ATTRS{idVendor}=="12d1" \
, ATTRS{idProduct}=="14fe" \
, RUN+="/sbin/usb_modeswitch -X -v 12d1 -p 14fe"
